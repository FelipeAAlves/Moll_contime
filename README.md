
This package contains `Julia` code to solve heterogeneous agent models using continuous time methods taken
from [Moll's website](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/) and from *"Heterogeneous Agent Models in Continuous Time"*
paper from Moll and co-authors. Specifically, I have replicated the Huggett economy example discussed on the appendix of **HACT**.

This is intended to complement the lecture given at our informal **NYU Computational Workshop 2017**.
