abstract="Several examples of nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations are given which arise in financial applications. The concept of a visocisity solution is introduced. Sufficient conditions which ensure that a numerical scheme converges to the viscosity solution are discussed. Numerical examples based on an uncertain volatility model are presented which show that seemingly reasonable discretization methods (which do not satisfy the sufficient conditions for convergence) fail to converge to the viscosity solution.",
