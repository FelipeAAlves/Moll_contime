abstract="Several examples of nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations are given which arise in financial applications. The concept of a visocisity solution is introduced. Sufficient conditions which ensure that a numerical scheme converges to the viscosity solution are discussed. Numerical examples based on an uncertain volatility model are presented which show that seemingly reasonable discretization methods (which do not satisfy the sufficient conditions for convergence) fail to converge to the viscosity solution.",

  abstract={This textbook provides all tools required to easily solve intertemporal optimization problems in economics, finance, business administration and related disciplines. The focus of this textbook is on 'learning through examples' and gives a very quick access to all methods required by an undergraduate student, a PhD student and an experienced researcher who wants to explore new fields or confirm existing knowledge. Given that discrete and continuous time problems are given equal attention, insights gained in one area can be used for learning solutions methods more quickly in other contexts. This step-by-step approach is especially useful for the transition from deterministic to stochastic worlds. When it comes to stochastic methods in continuous time, the applied focus of this book is the most useful. Formulating and solving problems under continuous time uncertainty has never been explained in such a non-technical and highly accessible way.},

 year = {2009}
 abstract = {<p>In economic situations where action entails a fixed cost, inaction is the norm. Action is taken infrequently, and adjustments are large when they occur. Interest in economic models that exhibit ''lumpy'' behavior of this kind has exploded in recent years, spurred by growing evidence that it is typical in many important economic decisions, including price setting, investment, hiring, durable goods purchases, and portfolio management.</p><p>In<em>The Economics of Inaction</em>, leading economist Nancy Stokey shows how the tools of stochastic control can be applied to dynamic problems of decision making under uncertainty when fixed costs are present. Stokey provides a self-contained, rigorous, and clear treatment of two types of models, impulse and instantaneous control. She presents the relevant results about Brownian motion and other diffusion processes, develops methods for analyzing each type of problem, and discusses applications to price setting, investment, and durable goods purchases.</p><p>This authoritative book will be essential reading for graduate students and researchers in macroeconomics.</p>},

  abstract={We revisit the transmission mechanism of monetary policy for household consumption in a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. The model yields empirically realistic distributions of household wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two key features: multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and an idiosyncratic income process with leptokurtic income changes. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where intertemporal substitution drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption.},
